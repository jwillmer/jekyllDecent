This is a [blog template](https://github.com/jwillmer/jekyllDecent) for a static site generator named [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) based on a [Ghost](https://ghost.org) template named [Decent](https://github.com/serenader2014/decent). 
If you like to see the theme in production have a look at [jwillmer.de](http://jwillmer.de).

## Installation

- To generate/host the blog you need to [install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). 
- For the plugins (github-pages) you need to install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/): `gem install bundler`
   - Open a command prompt and install the plugins (github-pages): `bundle install`
   - On Windows you can get an exception if you have not the latest rubygems. To solve it you get the latest rubygems or you can read [How to install Jekyll and pages-gem on Windows (x64)](http://jwillmer.de/blog/tutorial/how-to-install-jekyll-and-pages-gem-on-windows-10-x46) or you just remove the plugins by deleting the `Gemfile` and delete all `gems:` from the `_config.yml`. 

### Build

- To build the static site you can use the generated site folder that Jekyll creates when you use `jekyll serve` or you can build it explicitly with `jekyll build`.
- To [auto refresh your browser on changes](https://github.com/awood/hawkins) run jekyll with the following command `jekyll liveserve`
- If you like to use GitHub to host your blog you can [fork this project](https://github.com/jwillmer/jekyllDecent) and publish the code to `gh-pages`. GitHub has jekyll included and will generate the site for you.


## User Content

Blogposts can be written in [Markdown](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). 

- The folder for blog content is `_posts`
- For author details you need to modify `_data/authors.yml`
- For cv details you need to modify `_data/cv.yml` 
- If you change the author in `_data` you need to change the `author` attribute in `_posts` and `_pages` as well 
- For site properties (like the name) you need to modify `_config.yml` and `robots.txt`

After modifying `*.yml` files you need to restart jekyll to take effect.

### YAML Features

Following (additional) features are supported in the header ([YAML Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/)) of each post. A detailed description can be found in the [YAML Custom Features post]({{ "/blog/features/YAML-Features" | absolute_url }}).
